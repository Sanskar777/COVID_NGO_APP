Would you be able to help in the global effort against the new Coronavirus, from the safety of your own home?
If you have time to spare during lockdown, our Coronavirus Action project can keep you busy, give you a bigger perspective, and help communities around the world be better informed.

You can help give as many people as possible the opportunity to see our lesson about Covid-19 simply by:
• Researching organisations who might be able to use or share the lesson
• Making a list of the organisations you find
• Passing the list on to us
